            <h3>So easy your human companion could do it too!</h3>
            <p>In my home province — Ontario, Canada — there is a movement to improve physical health called Make Your Day Harder. The basic premise is that making small tweaks to daily routines to increase physical activity can add up and improve health.</p>

                Take the stairs instead of the elevator. Get off the bus one stop before your destination. Take the parking spot farthest away from the entrance at work.
                
                “Maybe easier isn’t really better…” is this group’s motto.
                
                I couldn’t agree more. Those elevator-hating far-parkers are onto something.
                
                Of course, sitting in front of a computer writing code isn’t going to improve your physical health. JavaScript is great for building apps, not abs.
                
                I don’t think it’s too much of a stretch, though, to suggest that learning how to program is healthy for your brain. Healthier, at least, than bingeing Iron Fist or thumbing through celebrity Instagram accounts.<br><br>
                
                For me, even after I started coding, the default during downtime is still too often leisure. This month, for instance, I have already spent dozens of hours watching genetic outliers throw a ball at a metal ring. This is otherwise known as the NBA playoffs. Since I’m a Toronto Raptors fan, you could also call it self-induced torture.
                
                Does watching so much basketball — alone, in my basement — benefit me in any way? Well, I drink more beer when I watch sports. I eat more nachos and wings and potato chips. Mike and Ikes have made several appearances. Oh, and I often stay up late to watch the West Coast games, so I’m getting less sleep.<br><br>
                
                In other words, watching sports, for me, is a vice. I enjoy it, but it’s actually bad for me. It provides me with entertainment, but nothing else. Except for love handles and the occasional mid-afternoon yawn attack.<br>
                
                But it’s easy. It’s oh so easy. Plop on couch. Crack open Corona. Kick up your feet. Sit there for three hours.
                
                The easy path is more tempting. The difficult path is more rewarding.
                
                Embracing difficulty
                I was again reminded of the value of embracing difficulty while watching the movie Hidden Figures. The film featured an excerpt of John F Kennedy’s “We choose to go to the moon” speech. The United States pursued space travel not despite it being difficult, the president declared, but rather because it was difficult.<br><br>
